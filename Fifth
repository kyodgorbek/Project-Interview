What are your thoughts about Fragments? Do you like or hate them? Why?

I prefer to use Fragment Because, Fragment helped me in my Baking App designing for different screen sizes.
I combine multiple fragments in a single activity to build a multi-pane UI and reused a fragment in multiple activities.
For instance, many people think that fragments add more complexity than needed and hence dislike them
