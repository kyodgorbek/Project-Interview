If you were to start your Android position today, what would be your goals a year from now?

Mainly I would like to focus on testing, continuous integration, reactive programming and algorithmic skills as 
it would help me become a much better software engineer. Apart from that I would like to increase my team membership skills
and actively contribue to the engineering team I work with.
